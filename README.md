# Differential-Expression-in-Pancreatic-Cancer
A Programming II project studying the differences in expression among pancreatic cancer adenocarcinoma tissue vs. normal tissue, from GEO accession GSE28735 (Zhang G, Schetter A, He P, Funamizu N et al., 2012). In particular, we hope to elucidate any differences in expression among  DNA canonical checkpoint proteins such as APE2.
